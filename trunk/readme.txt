Add a signup form to your sidebar for your Mailigen mailing list.

== Description ==

This plugin provides an easy, lightweight way to let your users sign up for your Mailigen list.
The Wordpress widget sign-up form is a double opt-in signup form, just like your other Mailigen forms. When a potential subscriber fills out the form, they will receive confirmation to their email address asking them to confirm their subscription.

The Mailigen Widget:

*	is easy to use
*	is easy to configure
*	is AJAX-based
*	displays the collection of only information that you actually need (i.e., an email address and a name) to ask from your mailers
